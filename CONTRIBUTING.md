# Contributing to Simply Give
Together we can create something amazing. Here are some guidelines to follow along the way.


## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All code changes happen through [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) with PUll Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions will be made under the MIT License
Make sure to look it over and know what it entails. [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
Please make sure the bug hasn't been reported and fixed already.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Bug reports should be clear, detailed, and include code if possible
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report written by Brian Danielak.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes of things you tried
